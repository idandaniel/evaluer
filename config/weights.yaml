# Grading Configuration
#
# Hierarchical structure: Subject -> Module -> Exercise
#
# Rules:
# - All subject weights must sum to 1.0
# - All module weights within a subject must sum to 1.0  
# - All exercise weights within a module must sum to 1.0
# - Use decimal values (e.g., 0.4, not 40%)
# - Missing subjects/modules/exercises will use equal distribution
